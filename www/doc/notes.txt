programming guidelines:

Separate code spaces for business logic, views, and low level utilities.
Don't write until something is needed.
Avoid conditionals. If they're needed, consider creating other procs.
If in doubt, throw it out.
constructor=view/object
# this page split into MVC components:
#  inputs/observations (model), actions (controller), and outputs/reports (view) sections


Rationalization on using scheduler instead of callbacks: If callbacks are interrupted, a progression will not be polled to pickup where left off if interrupted --and delays are not as easily detected in a callback system vs. a system forced to use a scheduling process.

Make a table showing representation between db ref and tcl object_arr(element) returned in
hf_nc_* procs ie possibly available to hfl_local_* procs when called.

Note about parameter priorityThreshold in monitoring. The default is 3. This allows all priority level 0,1, and 2 monitoring priorities to not be interrupted in schedule by a lower priority call that has been delayed for some time. Dynamic priority is priority - delay in seconds / interval_seconds. If Dynamic priority is below priorityThreshold, dynamic priority is set to priorityThreshold+1. 

create a refresh button (circle w/arrow) and a cancel button (red circle w light grey x)

make esrg-ex-N example pages for each content grouping type.

status cols:
power/active  
 on/off/disabled/suspended/interrupted

disabled is an admin/system set state
a suspend/interrupt state converts to off after user turns off
a suspend/interrupt state reverts to suspend/interrupt if attempts at start/on are unsuccessful, needing user intervention (alert)
a disable state is not convertable by user 
an abandoned/timed-out suspend state converts to disabled after X days/weeks/months
archived are disabled
new are off/inactive
pre-new are off/inactive

activity feedback status:
face, light, linear graph or numeric index 0 = inactive, 10 = best relative performance

user buttons:

start/stop
archive, readme, help

General UI.

If a customer_id is not already chosen, Get customer_ids for user_id

If customer_ids > list_min, show pagination_bar of customers as links
if multiple customer_ids, show list of customers

Show first N items (monitors etc) needing most attention.

If customer_id is clicked, scope to customer_id and show all for customer_id (paginated)
